# deep_learning
Description: This repository contains demos, tutorials, and practical lab sessions (with solutions) covering key topics in deep learning. The materials are designed to support hands-on learning and provide implementations of fundamental and advanced deep learning concepts.

📌 Topics Covered
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) – Basics of deep learning, backpropagation, and multilayer perceptrons.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) – Image processing, feature extraction, and popular architectures (e.g., LeNet, ResNet).

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) – Sequential data processing, LSTMs, and GRUs.

Language Models – Traditional and neural approaches to text modeling.
Transformers – Attention mechanisms, BERT, GPT, and modern NLP architectures.

Generative Models –

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – Image generation and adversarial training.

Autoencoders (AE) – Dimensionality reduction and feature learning.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) – Probabilistic generative modeling.

🛠 Contents
